# PJE Autom√°tico v1.3.0 - Browser Connection Recovery Update

## Summary of Improvements

This update addresses critical browser connection issues that were causing the program to fail when the browser session became invalid. The main improvements include:

## üîß Key Fixes

### 1. Enhanced Browser Session Management
- **Improved error detection**: Now properly identifies when browser sessions become invalid
- **Session validation**: Checks browser session validity before attempting operations
- **Process monitoring**: Verifies if the browser process is still running

### 2. Better Error Handling
- **Session-specific errors**: Distinguishes between browser session errors and other types of errors
- **Graceful recovery**: Allows the program to continue when possible instead of crashing
- **Reduced retry attempts**: Changed from 5 to 3 consecutive errors before exit for faster recovery

### 3. Robust Browser Monitoring
- **Process validation**: Checks if Chrome process is still alive
- **Session recovery**: Attempts to recover from temporary session issues
- **Clear exit conditions**: Exits cleanly when browser is actually closed by user

### 4. Power Management Integration
- **Suspend/Resume handling**: Maintains functionality during system sleep/wake cycles
- **Connection restoration**: Automatically tests and restores connections after system resume
- **Windows power events**: Registers for Windows power management notifications

## üöÄ Technical Improvements

### Browser Session Error Detection
```python
# Now detects these specific browser issues:
- 'invalid session'
- 'session deleted' 
- 'no such session'
- 'chrome not reachable'
```

### Smart Recovery Logic
- **Process check**: Verifies Chrome process is running before retry attempts
- **Graceful degradation**: Continues operation when possible
- **Clean exits**: Proper notification when browser is actually closed

### Power Management
- **Windows API integration**: Uses Win32 APIs for power event handling
- **Callback system**: Registers suspend/resume callbacks for different components
- **Time gap detection**: Identifies potential suspend/resume events by monitoring time gaps

## üîí Stability Enhancements

### Before (v1.2.0)
- Browser connection loss ‚Üí Program crash
- Suspend/hibernate ‚Üí Program termination
- Session errors ‚Üí Infinite retry loops
- Multiple browser instances ‚Üí Conflicts

### After (v1.3.0)
- Browser connection loss ‚Üí Smart recovery or clean exit
- Suspend/hibernate ‚Üí Maintained operation with recovery
- Session errors ‚Üí Proper error categorization and handling
- Multiple browser instances ‚Üí Improved cleanup and management

## üõ†Ô∏è Dependencies Added
- `pywin32>=227` - For Windows power management APIs

## üìã Usage Notes

1. **Automatic Recovery**: The program now automatically handles temporary browser connection issues
2. **Clean Exits**: When the browser is actually closed, the program exits cleanly with proper notification
3. **Suspend Handling**: System suspend/hibernate no longer terminates the program
4. **Better Feedback**: More detailed logging helps identify what's happening during recovery

## üîç Error Messages Explained

- `[Monitor] Browser session invalid` - Temporary session issue, attempting recovery
- `[Monitor] Browser process terminated - exiting` - Browser was actually closed
- `[Clipboard] Browser session lost` - Session issue during clipboard processing
- `[Monitor] Detected potential suspend/resume` - System wake-up detected

This update significantly improves the reliability and user experience of PJE Autom√°tico, especially in environments where the computer may be suspended or where browser connections might be unstable.
